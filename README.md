# OS2 course material but in a repo
Screw sharepoint

Screw Microsoft office

I just want some nice simple docs

## How to use
I suggest you clone this repo or download the source code, and use VSCode to view the files. You can right-click on any of the `.md` files and open the preview window to see a nice, formatted output with images inline and all. 

## Built Output
If you want documents, there are three types of files are generated from each source script, use whichever you prefer.

* Word `docx` files (highlighted and indented)
* PDFs from `markdown-pdf` (sometimes a little buggy, but the code is indented right)
* PDFs from `kramdown` (appended with a `-k` in the filename, code is not indented or syntax highlighted, something I'm working on)
